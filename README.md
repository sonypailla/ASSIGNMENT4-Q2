## Project Description:
This project demonstrates how to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the `spaCy` library in Python. The script analyzes a sentence to identify named entities such as people, places, dates, and more. It prints the entity text, its label, and the character positions within the input sentence.

## Tools Used:
- Python 3.x
- spaCy library (`en_core_web_sm` model)

## Installation:
To install the required dependencies, run the following:

```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
